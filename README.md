# Purpose

## Create
Create instances of Suppliers, Ranges, Rolls and Cuts, including all relevant data that is required for each item.
## Read
Pull this information, so that the user can see the data linked to a particular item. i.e Suppliers, or Ranges that are linked 
to a particular Supplier. Also to be able to manipulate this data to bring back relevant information for the user. i.e An overall
roll balance for a particular roll.
## Update
Allow the user to update the data that has already been created. i.e Customer changes their cut size, or a Roll has been delivered short.
## Delete
Allows the user to delete data that is no longer required. i.e Rolls that have been completely sold, and all cuts have been taken from it.
